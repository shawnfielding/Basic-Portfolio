				<p>Shawn Fielding has lived many professional lives already: 
				<ul>
					<li>Professional Librarian</li>
					<li>Program and Project Manager</li>
					<li>Department Manager</li>
					<li>Knowledge and Enterprise Content Manager</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>He tends to overdo things until they are better than requested, which has pretty much meant that he worked himself out of a job a couple times now in the content management area.</p>
				<p>So Shawn, even with the babyface, is going through a midlife crisis and realising this is his last chance to do what he loves.  Shawn realized that he is happiest when he is playing with code directly.</p>
				<p>However, his skills are from a time that even apps really were not a thing.  So he is refreshing, getting back to mastery.</p>
				<p>So he is making the blind leap.  He sure hopes that it works out.</p>
